    <em>The software for <strong>Capability Provenance in Language Models</strong> (COLM 2026):</em><br>
    a training-data attribution pipeline that maps which regions of a pretraining corpus
    support different reasoning capabilities, and validates those regions with targeted unlearning.

## Overview

This repository will host the audited code for **"Capability Provenance in Language Models: A Case Study in Social Reasoning"** (COLM 2026). The pipeline runs gradient-based training-data attribution over a stratified sample of the Dolma3 corpus, aggregates document-level influence to corpus regions defined by the WebOrganizer 24×24 topic-by-format taxonomy, and validates the flagged regions with selective unlearning.

The full results, figures, and method write-up live in the **[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.19625)** and on the **[project site](https://eilab.gatech.edu/social-data-attribution/)**. This repository is the software.

> ⚠️ **Status.** The project website is live now. The audited code and aggregate artifacts (sampling manifests, the 576×4 bin-level influence matrix, unlearning checkpoints) arrive with the camera-ready release. Sections marked **pending** below are staged for that release and filled when the code ports in.

## Results at a glance

The headline scale of the study (full analysis and figures in the paper and on the site):

| | |
|---|---|
| **576** topic-format bins | **5.68M** documents in the working set |
| **4** contrastive benchmarks | **+1.60 pp** SocialIQA unlearning damage (p ≈ 10⁻⁵) |

## Repository structure

> Pending the code port. The intended layout mirrors the audited pipeline; final paths are confirmed at release.

```
src/
├── data_attribution/      # attribution, benchmark probes, aggregation, analysis
│   ├── attribution/       # gradient-based TDA (TrackStar via Bergson)
│   ├── evaluation/        # OLMES benchmark probes
│   └── analysis/          # bin-level influence aggregation, cross-benchmark stats
├── dolma/                 # corpus construction: dedup, WebOrganizer enrichment, stratified sampling
└── unlearning/            # influence-targeted vs matched-random unlearning (LoRA, NGDiff)
```

Each package maps to a pipeline stage: **corpus construction** (`dolma/`) → **benchmark probes** (`data_attribution/evaluation/`) → **attribution** (`data_attribution/attribution/`) → **aggregation** (`data_attribution/analysis/`) → **unlearning** (`unlearning/`).

## Quick start

> ⚠️ **Pending.** The code arrives with the camera-ready release. The intended workflow:

```bash
# clone, then install (Python 3.12, uv-managed, src/ layout)
git clone https://github.com/eilab-gt/social-data-attribution.git
cd social-data-attribution
uv sync

# reproduce a headline result (command confirmed at release)
# uv run data-attribution run <recipe>   # pending
```

The pipeline uses two vendored dependencies — **Bergson** (TrackStar attribution) and **ai2-olmes** (eval harness) — bootstrapped by a setup script. Exact install and reproduce commands are pinned here at release.

## Method

The central move is aggregation: every benchmark query is traced back to many documents, then summarized into comparable corpus regions. Dolma3 is de-duplicated, classified into WebOrganizer's 24 topic × 24 format taxonomy, and sampled into a 576-bin working set. Benchmark query gradients come from OLMo3-7B Instruct; document gradients and corpus-side curvature are computed on OLMo3-7B Base. Document-level influence is aggregated to a signed 576-bin influence matrix, contrasted across benchmarks, and the flagged regions are tested causally with selective unlearning. Figure 1 above shows the pipeline; the paper carries the depth.

## Data & models

| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| Base model | `allenai/Olmo-3-1025-7B` (OLMo3-7B Base) |
| Instruction model | `allenai/Olmo-3-7B-Instruct` (query gradients) |
| Corpus | Dolma3, de-duplicated, ~1.26B unique documents |
| Working set | 5.68M documents, stratified across 576 WebOrganizer bins |
| Benchmarks | SocialIQA, MMLU Social Sciences, ARC-Challenge, MMLU STEM (headline 2×2); also GSM8K, ARC-Easy, BBH social tasks |
| Attribution | gradient-based TDA via TrackStar (Bergson) |
| Compute | ~37K H200-equivalent GPU-hours |

Public Hugging Face buckets and the released aggregate artifacts are listed in the **[Roadmap](#roadmap)**. No private or cluster-specific paths are referenced.

## Roadmap

- [x] Project website live ([eilab.gatech.edu/social-data-attribution](https://eilab.gatech.edu/social-data-attribution/))
- [x] Paper on arXiv ([2606.19625](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.19625))
- [ ] Audited code port (Copybara)
- [ ] Sampling manifests
- [ ] 576×4 bin-level influence matrix (aggregate; no document-level scores)
- [ ] Unlearning checkpoints (LoRA adapters)
- [ ] Hugging Face Hub release (aggregate artifacts)

Released artifacts are **aggregate, bin-level by design** — document-level attribution scores are deliberately not released.

## Limitations

- Attribution is an analytic lens, not an exact proof of causal necessity for individual documents; unlearning validates aggregate patterns without eliminating approximation error.
- The analysis runs on a 5.68M-document stratified working set drawn from the ~1.26B-document population; results do not characterize every document in the full corpus.
- Unlearning shows a corpus region is load-bearing; it does not explain the mechanism by which those documents shape behavior.
- The deep-dive is measured on one open-data ecosystem (OLMo3-7B / Dolma3). Generalization across model families is an open question.
- Released artifacts are aggregate bin-level statistics by design — no document-level attribution scores.
